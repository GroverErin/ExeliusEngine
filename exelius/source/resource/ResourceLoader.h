	/// Loading of resources is managed by this class. Resources can
	/// be loaded in the main thread or on a separate dedicated thread.
	/// 
	/// The threaded loading is implemented via a Double Buffered System.
	/// 
	/// The resource loader then calls on the resource factory to
	/// create the specific type of resources based on criteria defined
	/// by the factory. For the engine's factory, this is done by
	/// extracting the file extention.
	/// @see ResourceFactory
	/// @see ExeliusResourceFactory
	/// 
	/// Lastly, the loaded resource is then stored as a reference counted
	/// object within a resource database. This allows for resources to
	/// have a lifetime determined by their use.
	/// @see ResourceDatabase
	/// 
	/// The resource loader should not necessarily need to be used by
	/// client applications directly. The interface ResourceHandle is
	/// provided and will handle this functionality in such a way that
	/// it is safe for the user as resources have such a volatile
	/// lifetime.
	/// @see ResourceHandle
	/// 
	/// @todo
	/// The resource loader needs some additional functionality:
	/// 1) The ability to load assets from a compressed file
	/// is not functional.
	/// 2) The use of engine and client resources is not in
	/// use.
	/// 3) The engine should be able to determine whether or
	/// not to load from a zip automatically via the data provided
	/// by the config file.
	/// 4) The resource loader does not make use of the
	/// config file currently.
	/// 5) The resource loader should be capable of being
	/// forced into single threaded mode.
	/// 6) The resource loader should allow for hot-reloading
	/// of assets in some form, whether that is automatic or manual.
	/// This could also be a user setting as well.
	/// 7) The loader should allow multiple listeners of a resource
	/// to be passed in to a single resource load call.
